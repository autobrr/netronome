## üì¶ External Dependencies

Netronome requires the following external tools for full functionality:

### Required for Speed Tests

- **iperf3** - Required for iperf3 speed testing (automatically included in Docker). Note: Jitter measurement is not supported for iperf3 tests
- **librespeed-cli** - Required for LibreSpeed testing (automatically included in Docker)
- **traceroute** - Required for network diagnostics (automatically included in Docker, usually pre-installed on most systems)

### Required for Development

- **air** - Go live reload tool for `make watch` command
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for `make dev` command
- **pnpm** - Package manager for frontend dependencies

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Linux Generic

Download the latest release, or download the source code and build it yourself using make build.

```bash
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/autobrr/netronome/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\" -f4)
```

**Note**: Release binaries still include most temperature monitoring (CPU, NVMe, battery) via gopsutil. Only SATA/HDD temperatures and disk model names require building from source with SMART support. See [Building from Source](#building-from-source) for details.

#### Unpack

Run with root or sudo. If you do not have root, or are on a shared system, place the binaries somewhere in your home directory like ~/.bin.

```bash
tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf netronome*.tar.gz
```

This will extract both netronome and netronomectl to /usr/local/bin. Note: If the command fails, prefix it with sudo and re-run again.
Systemd (Recommended)

On Linux-based systems, it is recommended to run netronome as a sort of service with auto-restarting capabilities, in order to account for potential downtime. The most common way is to do it via systemd.

You will need to create a service file in /etc/systemd/system/ called netronome.service.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/netronome@.service
```

Then place the following content inside the file (e.g. via nano/vim/ed):

```
[Unit]
Description=netronome service for %i
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
Group=%i
ExecStart=/usr/bin/netronome --config=/home/%i/.config/netronome/config.toml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service. Enable will make it startup on reboot.

```bash
systemctl enable -q --now --user netronome@$USER
```

By default, the configuration is set to listen on 127.0.0.1. While netronome works fine as is exposed to the internet, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy like nginx, caddy or traefik.

If you are not running a reverse proxy change host in the config.toml to 0.0.0.0.

### Docker Installation

For containerized deployment see [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [docker-compose.postgres.yml](docker-compose.postgres.yml).

**Important:** The Docker container requires the `NET_RAW` capability for MTR and privileged ping operations to work properly. This is already configured in the provided docker-compose files.

If running Docker manually, add the capability:

```bash
docker run --cap-add=NET_RAW -p 7575:7575 -v ./netronome:/data ghcr.io/autobrr/netronome:latest
```

**Tailscale Sidecar Setup**: For running Netronome with a Tailscale sidecar container for secure networking and agent discovery, see our [Docker Tailscale Sidecar Guide](docs/docker-tailscale-sidecar.md).

**Note about MTR without NET_RAW**: When MTR runs without the NET_RAW capability (unprivileged mode), it falls back to UDP mode instead of ICMP. UDP mode may show higher packet loss than ICMP because:

- Some routers prioritize ICMP traffic over UDP
- Firewalls may rate-limit or drop UDP packets more aggressively
- UDP packets may be treated as lower priority during network congestion

For the most accurate packet loss measurements, ensure the container has NET_RAW capability or run netronome with sudo/root privileges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Configuration File (config.toml)

Netronome can be configured using a TOML file. Generate a default configuration:

```bash
netronome generate-config
```

This will create a `config.toml` file with default settings:

```toml
# Netronome Configuration

[database]
type = "sqlite"
path = "netronome.db"

[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 7575
base_url = ""

[logging]
level = "info"

[oidc]
issuer = ""
client_id = ""
client_secret = ""
redirect_url = ""

[speedtest]
timeout = 30

[speedtest.iperf]
test_duration = 10
parallel_conns = 4
timeout = 30

[speedtest.iperf.ping]
count = 5
interval = 1000
timeout = 10

[geoip]
country_database_path = ""
asn_database_path = ""


[tailscale]
enabled = false
method = "auto"  # "auto" (default), "host", or "tsnet"

# TSNet settings (used when method="tsnet" or auto-detected)
# auth_key = ""  # Required for tsnet mode
# hostname = ""  # Custom hostname (optional)
# ephemeral = false  # Remove on shutdown
# state_dir = "~/.config/netronome/tsnet"  # Directory for tsnet state
# control_url = ""  # For Headscale (optional)

# Server discovery settings
auto_discover = true  # Auto-discover Tailscale agents
discovery_interval = "5m"  # How often to check for new agents
discovery_port = 8200  # Port to probe for agents
# discovery_prefix = ""  # Only discover agents with this prefix (optional)
```

#### LibreSpeed Configuration

Netronome supports LibreSpeed servers for speed testing. A `librespeed-servers.json` file should be placed in the same directory as your configuration file. This file contains the LibreSpeed server definitions.

Example `librespeed-servers.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Clouvider - London, UK",
    "server": "http://lon.speedtest.clouvider.net/backend",
    "dlURL": "garbage.php",
    "ulURL": "empty.php",
    "pingURL": "empty.php",
    "getIpURL": "getIP.php"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Your Custom Server",
    "server": "http://your-server.example.com/backend",
    "dlURL": "garbage.php",
    "ulURL": "empty.php",
    "pingURL": "empty.php",
    "getIpURL": "getIP.php"
  }
]
```

**Note:** When using Docker, the LibreSpeed CLI tool (`librespeed-cli`) is automatically included in the container.

### System Monitoring

Netronome includes a comprehensive distributed monitoring system using lightweight agents that can be deployed on remote servers to track bandwidth, hardware resources, and system information.

#### Binary Types

Netronome provides two binary options for different deployment scenarios:

- **`netronome`** - Full server binary (~66MB) with complete web interface, database, and agent functionality
- **`netronome-agent`** - Lightweight agent-only binary (~32MB) optimized for distributed monitoring

**When to use each:**
- **Full Binary (`netronome`)**: Main server deployment, development, or when you need all commands
- **Agent Binary (`netronome-agent`)**: Remote monitoring agents, resource-constrained deployments, or containerized agents

Both binaries are included in release archives. The installation script automatically detects and prefers the lightweight agent binary when available.

#### Agent Setup

Netronome agents can be deployed using either binary depending on your needs:

- **Remote servers**: Monitor system resources, bandwidth, and hardware across different servers/locations
- **Same server**: Useful when Netronome runs in Docker but you want to monitor the host system

##### Quick Installation (Recommended)

Use our interactive one-liner installation script for automatic setup:

```bash
curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash
```

The script provides a **fully interactive installation** experience and will:

- Check for vnstat dependency
- **Interactively prompt** for network interface selection
- **Interactively choose** API key configuration (generate, custom, or none)
- **Interactively configure** listening address and port
- Create a systemd/launchd service
- Start the agent automatically
- **Interactively enable** automatic daily updates

##### Installation Options

```bash
# Interactive installation (prompts for all options) - RECOMMENDED
curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash

# Enable auto-updates without prompting (non-interactive)
curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash -s -- --auto-update true

# Disable auto-updates without prompting (non-interactive)
curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash -s -- --auto-update false

# Update existing installation
curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash -s -- --update

# Uninstall
curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

##### Automatic Updates

When enabled, the agent will automatically check for updates daily at a random time (with up to 4 hours delay to prevent server overload). The update process:

1. Checks GitHub releases for newer versions
2. Downloads and verifies the new binary
3. Automatically restarts the service

You can check the update status with:

```bash
# Check update timer status
systemctl status netronome-agent-update.timer

# View last update attempt
journalctl -u netronome-agent-update

# Manually trigger update
/opt/netronome/netronome update
```

##### Manual Installation

1. **Deploy the Agent**

   ```bash
   # Using the dedicated agent binary (recommended for agents)
   netronome-agent --api-key your-secret-key
   
   # Or using the full binary with agent command
   netronome agent --api-key your-secret-key

   # Run agent on custom host and port
   netronome-agent --host 192.168.1.100 --port 8300 --api-key your-secret-key

   # Run agent with specific interface
   netronome agent --interface eth0 --api-key your-secret-key

   # Include additional disk mounts (e.g., /mnt/storage)
   netronome agent --disk-include /mnt/storage --disk-include /mnt/backup

   # Exclude certain disk mounts from monitoring
   netronome agent --disk-exclude /boot --disk-exclude /tmp

   # Use host's existing tailscaled (if available)
   netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-method host

   # Create separate tsnet instance (requires auth key)
   netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-method tsnet --tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-xxx

   # Let it auto-detect (uses host if no auth key, tsnet if auth key provided)
   netronome agent --tailscale

   # Run with config file
   netronome agent --config /path/to/config.toml
   ```

2. **Agent Configuration**

   Add to your `config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [agent]
   host = "0.0.0.0"  # IP address to bind to (0.0.0.0 for all interfaces)
   port = 8200
   interface = ""    # Empty for all interfaces, or specify like "eth0"
   api_key = ""      # API key for authentication (recommended)
   disk_includes = []  # Additional disk mounts to monitor, e.g., ["/mnt/storage", "/mnt/backup"]
   disk_excludes = []  # Disk mounts to exclude from monitoring, e.g., ["/boot", "/tmp"]

   [monitor]
   enabled = true
   ```

3. **Add Agents in Netronome UI**
   - Navigate to the "Monitoring" tab
   - Click "Add Agent"
   - Enter agent details:
     - Name: Friendly name for the server
     - URL: `http://server-ip:8200` (agent URL)
     - API Key: Enter the key configured on the agent (if authentication is enabled)
     - Enable monitoring: Start monitoring immediately
   - Once connected, view:
     - Real-time bandwidth usage
     - CPU, memory, and disk utilization
     - System information and uptime
     - Network interface details
     - Temperature sensors (if available)

#### Agent Systemd Service

Create `/etc/systemd/system/netronome-agent.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Netronome Monitor Agent
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=netronome
Group=netronome
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/netronome agent --config /etc/netronome/agent-config.toml
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start:

```bash
systemctl enable netronome-agent
systemctl start netronome-agent
```

#### Security Considerations

- Agents expose bandwidth data via HTTP SSE endpoint
- No authentication on agent endpoint (rely on network security)
- Consider using reverse proxy with authentication if exposing to internet
- Agents are read-only and don't accept commands

#### Monitoring Capabilities

The monitoring agents provide comprehensive system visibility:

- **Bandwidth Monitoring**: Real-time network usage via vnstat integration
- **Hardware Statistics**:
  - CPU usage percentage and load averages
  - Memory and swap usage
  - Disk usage across all mounted filesystems
  - Temperature sensors (where available)
- **System Information**:
  - Hostname and kernel version
  - System uptime
  - Network interface details and IP addresses
  - Peak bandwidth statistics

#### Disk Filtering

The agent supports flexible disk filtering to customize which filesystems are monitored:

- **Include Specific Mounts**: Use `disk_includes` to monitor additional mount points that might be excluded by default (e.g., `/mnt/storage`, `/mnt/nas`)
- **Exclude Mounts**: Use `disk_excludes` to hide specific mount points from monitoring (e.g., `/boot`, `/tmp`)
- **Glob Patterns**: Supports standard glob patterns for flexible matching (e.g., `/System/*`, `/mnt/disk*`)
- **Priority**: Explicitly included paths take precedence over exclusion rules
- **Default Behavior**: Special filesystems (`/snap/*`, `/run/*`, tmpfs, devfs, squashfs) are excluded unless explicitly included

Examples:

```bash
# Monitor /mnt/storage even if it's a special filesystem type
netronome agent --disk-include /mnt/storage

# Exclude all System volumes on macOS
netronome agent --disk-exclude "/System/*"

# Include all /mnt/disk* mounts
netronome agent --disk-include "/mnt/disk*"

# Hide /boot and all /tmp* directories from monitoring
netronome agent --disk-exclude /boot --disk-exclude "/tmp*"

# Using environment variables
export NETRONOME__AGENT_DISK_INCLUDES="/mnt/storage,/mnt/disk*"
export NETRONOME__AGENT_DISK_EXCLUDES="/boot,/tmp*,/System/*"
```

#### Data Accuracy and Unit Display

Netronome fetches bandwidth data directly from vnstat's native JSON output, ensuring exact data parity with other vnstat-based tools like swizzin panel.

**Unit Display**: Netronome uses proper binary units following IEC standards:

- **1 KiB = 1024 bytes** (binary kilobyte)
- **Displayed as**: KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB
- **Consistent with vnstat**: vnstat internally uses binary units

This ensures accurate and unambiguous representation of bandwidth data.

### Tailscale Integration

Netronome includes native Tailscale support, allowing agents to securely connect through Tailscale's mesh VPN without exposing ports or configuring NAT/firewall rules.

#### Key Features

- **Smart Auto-Detection**: Automatically chooses between creating tsnet instances or using host's tailscaled
- **Simplified Configuration**: Single `[tailscale]` section with intelligent defaults
- **Zero-configuration Networking**: Agents automatically connect through Tailscale's encrypted mesh network
- **Automatic Discovery**: Server automatically discovers ALL Netronome agents on configured port
- **Port-based Discovery**: Simply run agents on the configured port and they're automatically found
- **Flexible Deployment**: Use isolated tsnet instances OR leverage existing host tailscaled
- **Visual Indicators**: UI shows shield icons and badges for Tailscale-connected agents
- **Mixed Mode Support**: Run both Tailscale and traditional HTTP agents simultaneously
- **Defense in Depth**: Combine Tailscale network isolation with API key authentication

#### Quick Start

##### For Agents

1. **Get a Tailscale Auth Key**

   - Visit https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
   - Create a new auth key (reusable recommended for multiple agents)

2. **Start Agent with Tailscale**

   ```bash
   # Basic Tailscale agent (creates tsnet instance)
   ./bin/netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY

   # Use host's existing tailscaled (no new machine in Tailscale)
   ./bin/netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-method host

   # With custom hostname (any name works - no prefix required!)
   ./bin/netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-hostname "webserver-prod" \
     --tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY

   # Ephemeral agent (removes from Tailscale on shutdown)
   ./bin/netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-ephemeral \
     --tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY

   # With API key for additional security
   ./bin/netronome agent --tailscale --api-key "secret123" \
     --tailscale-auth-key tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY
   ```

3. **Using the Installation Script**
   ```bash
   # The install script supports Tailscale configuration
   curl -sL https://netrono.me/install-agent | bash
   # Follow prompts to enable Tailscale during setup
   ```

##### For Server

The server's Tailscale configuration intelligently chooses between using the host's tailscaled or creating a tsnet instance based on your configuration:

Add to your server's `config.toml`:

```toml
[tailscale]
enabled = true              # Enable Tailscale support
method = "auto"             # auto, host, or tsnet (default: auto)
# auth_key = ""             # Required only for tsnet mode
# hostname = ""             # Optional custom hostname

# Server discovery settings
auto_discover = true        # Auto-discover Tailscale agents
discovery_interval = "5m"   # How often to check for new agents
discovery_port = 8200       # Port to probe for agents
```

**How auto-detection works:**

- If `auth_key` is provided ‚Üí Uses tsnet (creates new Tailscale node)
- If `auth_key` is empty ‚Üí Uses host's tailscaled (no new node)
- Set `method = "host"` to force using host's tailscaled
- Set `method = "tsnet"` to force tsnet (requires auth_key)

4. **Start the Server**
   ```bash
   ./bin/netronome serve
   ```

#### Configuration Options

##### Unified Configuration (Agent or Server)

```toml
[tailscale]
enabled = false             # Enable Tailscale support
method = "auto"             # "auto" (default), "host", or "tsnet"

# TSNet settings (used when method="tsnet" or auto-detected)
auth_key = ""               # Required for tsnet mode
hostname = ""               # Custom hostname (optional)
ephemeral = false           # Remove on shutdown
state_dir = "~/.config/netronome/tsnet"  # Directory for tsnet state
control_url = ""            # For Headscale (optional)

# Server discovery settings
auto_discover = true        # Auto-discover Tailscale agents
discovery_interval = "5m"   # How often to check for new agents
discovery_port = 8200       # Port to probe for agents (agents must be listening on this port)
# discovery_prefix = ""     # Only discover agents with this prefix (optional)
```

**Important**: Agents must be running on the `discovery_port` (default 8200) to be automatically discovered. Start your agents with `--port 8200` or configure `[agent] port = 8200`.

**Note**: The old `[tailscale.agent]` and `[tailscale.monitor]` sections are deprecated but still supported for backward compatibility.

#### Environment Variables

All Tailscale settings can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# Core settings
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_ENABLED=true
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_METHOD="auto"  # or "host" or "tsnet"
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY="tskey-auth-YOUR-KEY"
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME="netronome-agent-web01"
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_EPHEMERAL=true

# Agent settings
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_AGENT_PORT=8200

# Server discovery
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_AUTO_DISCOVER=true
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_DISCOVERY_INTERVAL="2m"
export NETRONOME__TAILSCALE_DISCOVERY_PORT=8200
```

#### How It Works

1. **Agent Side**:

   - **Auto mode**: Automatically uses tsnet if auth_key provided, otherwise uses host
   - **With tsnet**: Creates isolated instance in configured state directory
   - **With host tailscaled**: Uses existing tailscaled daemon
   - Joins your Tailscale network with any hostname
   - Listens on the Tailscale network interface (100.x.x.x)
   - Regular HTTP/SSE endpoints work normally through Tailscale
   - Responds to `/netronome/info` for automatic identification

2. **Server Side**:

   - **Auto mode**: Automatically uses tsnet if auth_key provided, otherwise uses host
   - **With host tailscaled**: Discovery works using existing connection
   - **With tsnet**: Creates separate instance for discovery
   - Periodically scans all peers and probes configured discovery port
   - Identifies Netronome agents via `/netronome/info` endpoint
   - Automatically creates monitor entries for discovered agents
   - Uses Tailscale hostnames for reliable connectivity

3. **Discovery Process**:

   ```
   Server ‚Üí Scans all Tailscale peers
         ‚Üí Probes each peer on port 8200
         ‚Üí Checks /netronome/info endpoint
         ‚Üí Auto-adds verified Netronome agents
   ```

4. **Network Flow**:
   ```
   Agent (tailscale) ‚Üí Tailscale Network (encrypted) ‚Üí Server
   ```

#### Important: Existing Tailscale Installations

**Q: What if my server/agent already has tailscaled running?**

**A: You have several options:**

- **For Agents**:

  1. **Use host's tailscaled** (recommended): `netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-method host`

     - No new machine in Tailscale admin
     - Uses existing connection
     - Automatically discovered on configured port

  2. **Create separate tsnet**: `netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-auth-key tskey-xxx`

     - Creates new machine in Tailscale admin
     - Completely isolated from system tailscaled

  3. **Let it auto-detect**: `netronome agent --tailscale`
     - Uses host if no auth key provided
     - Creates tsnet if auth key provided

- **For Server**:
  1. **Let it auto-detect**: Set `enabled = true` without auth_key to use host
  2. **Force host mode**: Set `method = "host"` to always use host's tailscaled
  3. **Create tsnet**: Provide auth_key to create separate instance

**Q: How do I avoid creating extra machines in Tailscale?**

**A: Simply don't provide an auth key:**

```bash
# Agent will automatically use host's tailscaled
netronome agent --tailscale
# or explicitly:
netronome agent --tailscale --tailscale-method host

# Server will automatically use host's tailscaled
[tailscale]
enabled = true
# No auth_key = uses host automatically
```

#### Visual Indicators

The UI provides clear indicators for Tailscale connectivity:

- üõ°Ô∏è **Shield Icon**: Agent is connected via Tailscale
- **Auto-discovered Badge**: Agent was found via Tailscale discovery
- **Connection Info**: Shows Tailscale hostname in agent details

#### Troubleshooting

**Agent not discovered?**

- Check agent is running on port 8200 (default discovery port)
- Verify both server and agent are on same Tailnet
- Check logs: `grep -i tailscale /path/to/netronome.log`
- Ensure discovery is enabled on server
- Test manually: `curl http://<agent-hostname>:8200/netronome/info`

**Connection issues?**

- Verify Tailscale connectivity: `tailscale ping <agent-hostname>`
- Check agent is listening: `curl http://<agent-hostname>:8200/health`
- Ensure no firewall blocking Tailscale (100.64.0.0/10)

**Want to use existing tailscaled instead?**

- For agents: Run without `--tailscale` flag, access via host's Tailscale hostname
- For server: Skip `[tailscale]` config, manually add agents
- Both approaches work perfectly!

#### Security Considerations

- **Network Isolation**: Tailscale provides encrypted point-to-point connections
- **No Port Exposure**: Agents don't need public ports or NAT configuration
- **Access Control**: Use Tailscale ACLs to restrict agent access
- **API Keys**: Combine with API authentication for defense in depth
- **Ephemeral Nodes**: Use `--tailscale-ephemeral` for temporary agents

#### Advanced Usage

##### Headscale Support

For self-hosted Tailscale control servers:

```bash
netronome agent --tailscale \
  --tailscale-control-url "https://headscale.example.com" \
  --tailscale-auth-key "YOUR-HEADSCALE-KEY"
```

##### Multiple Tailnets

Run agents on different Tailnets by using separate state directories:

```bash
# Production Tailnet
netronome agent --tailscale \
  --tailscale-state-dir ~/.config/netronome/tailscale-prod \
  --tailscale-auth-key "PROD-KEY"

# Development Tailnet
netronome agent --tailscale \
  --tailscale-state-dir ~/.config/netronome/tailscale-dev \
  --tailscale-auth-key "DEV-KEY"
```

### Database

Netronome supports two database backends:

1. **SQLite** (Default)

   - No additional setup required

2. **PostgreSQL**
   - Configure via:
     ```bash
     NETRONOME__DB_TYPE=postgres
     NETRONOME__DB_HOST=localhost
     NETRONOME__DB_PORT=5432
     NETRONOME__DB_USER=postgres
     NETRONOME__DB_PASSWORD=your-password
     NETRONOME__DB_NAME=netronome
     NETRONOME__DB_SSLMODE=disable
     ```

### Authentication

Netronome supports two authentication methods:

1. **Built-in Authentication**

   - Username/password authentication
   - Default option if no OIDC is configured

2. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**

   - Integration with identity providers (Google, Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Pocket-ID, Authelia, Authentik etc.)
   - PKCE support
   - Configure via environment variables:
     ```bash
     OIDC_ISSUER=https://pocketid.domain.net
     OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     OIDC_REDIRECT_URL=https://netronome.domain.net/api/auth/oidc/callback
     ```

3. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Bypass authentication for specific network ranges or IP addresses.
   - Configure in `config.toml` using CIDR notation:
     ```toml
     [auth]
     whitelist = ["127.0.0.1/32"]
     ```

### Scheduling Intervals

Netronome supports two types of scheduling intervals for both speed tests and packet loss monitors:

#### 1. **Duration-based Intervals**

- Format: Standard Go duration strings (e.g., `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h"`, `"24h"`)
- Example: `"1m"` runs the test every 1 minute
- Next run calculation: Current time + interval duration + random jitter

#### 2. **Exact Time Intervals**

- Format: `"exact:HH:MM"` or `"exact:HH:MM,HH:MM"` for multiple times
- Example: `"exact:14:30"` runs at 2:30 PM daily
- Example: `"exact:00:00,12:00"` runs at midnight and noon daily
- Next run calculation: Next occurrence of specified time(s) + random jitter

#### Jitter (Randomization)

To prevent the "thundering herd" problem where all tests run simultaneously:

- **Duration-based**: Adds 1-300 seconds of random delay
- **Exact time**: Adds 1-60 seconds of random delay

This means if you have multiple monitors with the same interval, they won't all execute at exactly the same moment, preventing network congestion and ensuring more accurate results.

#### Startup and Missed Runs

When Netronome starts up, it recalculates the next run time for all scheduled tests:

- **Missed runs are NOT executed** - If Netronome was offline and missed scheduled runs, those tests won't be run retroactively
- **Next occurrence is calculated** - The scheduler finds the next valid time based on the interval
- **No catch-up behavior** - This prevents network flooding and ensures test results reflect current conditions

**Examples:**

- Exact time "exact:14:00" starting at 10:00 ‚Üí Next run: 14:00 today
- Exact time "exact:14:00" starting at 15:00 ‚Üí Next run: 14:00 tomorrow
- Duration "1h" starting anytime ‚Üí Next run: current time + 1 hour + jitter

This design ensures predictable scheduling and prevents outdated tests from running after downtime.

### Packet Loss Monitoring

Netronome features a comprehensive packet loss monitoring system integrated into the unified traceroute interface:

#### Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: Switch between single traceroute tests and continuous monitoring in one tab
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Choose between interval-based (10s to 24h) or exact daily times
- **Auto-start Monitors**: Option to start monitoring immediately upon creation
- **Real-time Progress**: Live test progress with animated indicators during active testing
- **Multiple Test Types**: ICMP ping with automatic MTR fallback for detailed hop analysis
- **Historical Tracking**: Performance trend charts showing packet loss and RTT over time
- **Monitor Lifecycle**: Full start/stop/edit/delete capabilities with visual status indicators
- **Schedule Visualization**: Color-coded badges showing monitoring schedules and states
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with appropriate privileges

#### Monitor States

- **Active Monitoring**: Running on schedule with real-time status updates
- **Stopped**: Manually stopped, schedule visible but monitoring disabled
- **Testing**: Currently running a test with live progress indication

#### Important Notes on Monitor Startup Behavior

By default, packet loss monitors **DO NOT** start automatically when Netronome starts. This prevents:

- Network congestion from multiple simultaneous tests
- False packet loss readings due to concurrent ICMP traffic
- Unexpected network usage on startup

Monitors will run on their configured intervals after being manually started by users. If you want monitors to start immediately on program startup (not recommended), you can set:

```toml
[speedtest.packetloss]
restore_monitors_on_startup = true  # WARNING: This will immediately run ALL enabled monitors
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Setting `restore_monitors_on_startup = true` will cause ALL enabled monitors to run their tests immediately when Netronome starts, which can cause significant network traffic and potentially inaccurate results due to congestion.

### GeoIP Configuration

Netronome can display country flags and ASN information in traceroute results using MaxMind's GeoLite2 databases.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Get a MaxMind License Key**

   - Sign up for a free account at [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
   - Generate a license key in your account dashboard

2. **Download the Databases**

   ```bash
   # Download GeoLite2-Country database (for country flags)
   curl -L "https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=GeoLite2-Country&license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&suffix=tar.gz" -o GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz
   tar -xzf GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz
   cp GeoLite2-Country_*/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb /path/to/your/databases/

   # Download GeoLite2-ASN database (for ASN information)
   curl -L "https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=GeoLite2-ASN&license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&suffix=tar.gz" -o GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz
   tar -xzf GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz
   cp GeoLite2-ASN_*/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb /path/to/your/databases/
   ```

3. **Configure Netronome**

   ```toml
   [geoip]
   country_database_path = "/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb"
   asn_database_path = "/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb"
   ```

   Or using environment variables:

   ```bash
   NETRONOME__GEOIP_COUNTRY_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
   NETRONOME__GEOIP_ASN_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb
   ```

**Note:** Both databases are optional. You can configure only one if you only want country flags or ASN information. The databases should be updated monthly for best accuracy.

#### Understanding MTR Packet Loss Calculations

MTR displays two types of packet loss measurements that serve different purposes:

1. **Overall Packet Loss** - Measures end-to-end connectivity to the final destination
2. **Hop-by-Hop Loss** - Shows packet loss at each intermediate router along the path

**Why Overall Loss Can Be 0% Despite Intermediate Hop Timeouts:**

It's common and normal to see 100% packet loss at intermediate hops (showing as timeouts) while overall packet loss remains 0%. This occurs because:

- **Security Policies**: Many routers block or rate-limit ICMP responses for security reasons
- **Router Configuration**: Routers prioritize data forwarding over responding to diagnostic packets
- **Load Balancing**: Actual traffic may take different paths than probe packets
- **Network Design**: Intermediate infrastructure may be "invisible" to traceroute but still functional

**Practical Interpretation:**

- **0% overall loss** = Your connection to the destination is working perfectly
- **100% loss at intermediate hops** = Those routers don't respond to probes, but they're still forwarding your traffic

This is why MTR shows both metrics - overall connectivity health (most important for users) and detailed path analysis (useful for network troubleshooting). The overall packet loss percentage is the primary indicator of your actual network performance to the destination.

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Temperature Monitoring

**Q: What temperature sensors are supported?**

Netronome supports comprehensive temperature monitoring across multiple platforms:

- **Linux**: CPU cores/package, NVMe drives, SATA drives (via SMART), ACPI thermal zones
- **macOS**: CPU dies, thermal devices, calibration sensors, NVMe drives, NAND storage, battery
- **Windows**: CPU cores/package, NVMe drives, ACPI thermal zones

**Q: Why don't I see disk temperatures in the monitoring interface?**

A: Disk temperature monitoring has several requirements:

1. **Platform Support**:

   - **Linux**: Full SMART support for SATA and NVMe drives
   - **macOS**: NVMe drives only (SATA drives not supported)
   - **Windows**: No SMART support (uses stub implementation)
   - **Other platforms**: No SMART support

2. **Build Requirements**:

   - Release binaries are built without SMART support but still include:
     - CPU temperature monitoring (all platforms)
     - NVMe temperature monitoring (via gopsutil)
     - Battery temperature monitoring
   - SMART functionality (only for SATA/HDD temps and disk model names) requires:
     - The `github.com/anatol/smart.go` library
     - Building from source with CGO enabled
     - Only available on Linux and macOS
   - The `nosmart` build tag disables SMART support but keeps gopsutil temperatures

3. **Privileges Required**: The agent must run with elevated privileges (root/sudo) to access SMART data from disk devices. Without proper permissions, HDD temperatures cannot be read.

4. **SMART Support**: The drive must support SMART (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) and have it enabled. Most modern drives support this, but some older or specialized drives may not.

5. **Temperature Sensor**: Not all drives report temperature via SMART. Some drives, particularly older models, may not have temperature sensors.

**Q: Why do I see multiple temperature entries for NVMe drives?**

A: This is a limitation of the gopsutil library used for temperature monitoring. NVMe drives often have multiple temperature sensors (composite and individual sensors), but the library doesn't always provide enough context to distinguish which physical drive each sensor belongs to. You may see duplicate "nvme_composite" entries without clear identification of which drive they represent.

**Q: What do the different temperature sensor categories mean?**

Temperature sensors are organized into user-friendly categories:

- **CPU**: All processor-related sensors (cores, dies, thermal devices, packages)
- **Storage**: NVMe drives, NAND storage, SATA drives (where supported)
- **Power & Battery**: Battery temperature sensors (mainly on laptops)
- **System**: Calibration sensors, ACPI thermal zones, and other system sensors

**Q: How can I enable disk temperature monitoring?**

Run the agent with elevated privileges:

```bash
# Using sudo
sudo netronome agent --config /path/to/config.toml

# Or in the systemd service file, run as root
User=root
```

**Note**: Running with elevated privileges has security implications. Only do this in trusted environments.

## üî® Building from Source

### Build Targets

Netronome provides multiple build targets for different use cases:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/autobrr/netronome
cd netronome

# Build full server binary with web interface (requires frontend build)
make build

# Build lightweight agent-only binary (no frontend required)
make build-agent  

# Build both binaries
make build-all
```

**Build target details:**
- **`make build`** - Full server binary (~66MB) with embedded web UI, database, all commands
- **`make build-agent`** - Agent-only binary (~32MB) with just monitoring functionality
- **`make build-all`** - Both binaries for comprehensive deployment options

### Building with Full SMART Support

The release binaries include most temperature monitoring (CPU, NVMe, battery) but lack SMART support for SATA/HDD temperatures and disk model names. To build with full SMART support on Linux or macOS:

```bash
# Build full server with SMART support (requires CGO, default when building locally)
CGO_ENABLED=1 make build

# Build agent with SMART support (requires CGO)
CGO_ENABLED=1 make build-agent

# The binaries will be in ./bin/ with full SMART support
sudo ./bin/netronome agent  # Run with sudo for SATA/HDD temperature access
sudo ./bin/netronome-agent  # Or use the dedicated agent binary
```

**Note**: SMART support requires `CGO_ENABLED=1` to interface with system disk libraries.

### Building without SMART Support

To build without SMART support (like the release binaries):

```bash
# Full binary without SMART
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags nosmart -o bin/netronome ./cmd/netronome

# Agent binary without SMART  
CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -tags nosmart -o bin/netronome-agent ./cmd/netronome-agent
```

**What works without SMART:**

- ‚úÖ CPU temperature monitoring (all cores, packages)
- ‚úÖ NVMe temperature monitoring
- ‚úÖ Battery temperature monitoring
- ‚úÖ Other system sensors via gopsutil

**What requires SMART (Linux/macOS only):**

- ‚ùå SATA/HDD temperature monitoring
- ‚ùå Disk model and serial number display

### Docker Build

The Docker images include SMART support by default:

```bash
make docker-build
make docker-run
```

**Note**: When running Docker containers, ensure you use `--cap-add=NET_RAW` and run with appropriate privileges for SMART disk access.
