## üì¶ External Dependencies

Netronome requires the following external tools for full functionality:

### Required for Speed Tests

- **iperf3** - Required for iperf3 speed testing (automatically included in Docker). Note: Jitter measurement is not supported for iperf3 tests
- **librespeed-cli** - Required for LibreSpeed testing (automatically included in Docker)
- **traceroute** - Required for network diagnostics (automatically included in Docker, usually pre-installed on most systems)

### Required for Development

- **air** - Go live reload tool for `make watch` command
- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer for `make dev` command
- **pnpm** - Package manager for frontend dependencies

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Linux Generic

Download the latest release, or download the source code and build it yourself using make build.

```bash
wget $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/autobrr/netronome/releases/latest | grep download | grep linux_x86_64 | cut -d\" -f4)
```

#### Unpack

Run with root or sudo. If you do not have root, or are on a shared system, place the binaries somewhere in your home directory like ~/.bin.

```bash
tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzf netronome*.tar.gz
```

This will extract both netronome and netronomectl to /usr/local/bin. Note: If the command fails, prefix it with sudo and re-run again.
Systemd (Recommended)

On Linux-based systems, it is recommended to run netronome as a sort of service with auto-restarting capabilities, in order to account for potential downtime. The most common way is to do it via systemd.

You will need to create a service file in /etc/systemd/system/ called netronome.service.

```bash
touch /etc/systemd/system/netronome@.service
```

Then place the following content inside the file (e.g. via nano/vim/ed):

```
[Unit]
Description=netronome service for %i
After=syslog.target network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=%i
Group=%i
ExecStart=/usr/bin/netronome --config=/home/%i/.config/netronome/config.toml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service. Enable will make it startup on reboot.

```bash
systemctl enable -q --now --user netronome@$USER
```

By default, the configuration is set to listen on 127.0.0.1. While netronome works fine as is exposed to the internet, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy like nginx, caddy or traefik.

If you are not running a reverse proxy change host in the config.toml to 0.0.0.0.

### Docker Installation

For containerized deployment see [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and [docker-compose.postgres.yml](docker-compose.postgres.yml).

**Important:** The Docker container requires the `NET_RAW` capability for MTR and privileged ping operations to work properly. This is already configured in the provided docker-compose files.

If running Docker manually, add the capability:

```bash
docker run --cap-add=NET_RAW -p 7575:7575 -v ./netronome:/data ghcr.io/autobrr/netronome:latest
```

**Note about MTR without NET_RAW**: When MTR runs without the NET_RAW capability (unprivileged mode), it falls back to UDP mode instead of ICMP. UDP mode may show higher packet loss than ICMP because:

- Some routers prioritize ICMP traffic over UDP
- Firewalls may rate-limit or drop UDP packets more aggressively
- UDP packets may be treated as lower priority during network congestion

For the most accurate packet loss measurements, ensure the container has NET_RAW capability or run netronome with sudo/root privileges.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Configuration File (config.toml)

Netronome can be configured using a TOML file. Generate a default configuration:

```bash
netronome generate-config
```

This will create a `config.toml` file with default settings:

```toml
# Netronome Configuration

[database]
type = "sqlite"
path = "netronome.db"

[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 7575
base_url = ""

[logging]
level = "info"

[oidc]
issuer = ""
client_id = ""
client_secret = ""
redirect_url = ""

[speedtest]
timeout = 30

[speedtest.iperf]
test_duration = 10
parallel_conns = 4
timeout = 30

[speedtest.iperf.ping]
count = 5
interval = 1000
timeout = 10

[geoip]
country_database_path = ""
asn_database_path = ""

[notifications]
enabled = false
webhook_url = ""
ping_threshold = 30
upload_threshold = 200
download_threshold = 200
```

#### LibreSpeed Configuration

Netronome supports LibreSpeed servers for speed testing. A `librespeed-servers.json` file should be placed in the same directory as your configuration file. This file contains the LibreSpeed server definitions.

Example `librespeed-servers.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Clouvider - London, UK",
    "server": "http://lon.speedtest.clouvider.net/backend",
    "dlURL": "garbage.php",
    "ulURL": "empty.php",
    "pingURL": "empty.php",
    "getIpURL": "getIP.php"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Your Custom Server",
    "server": "http://your-server.example.com/backend",
    "dlURL": "garbage.php",
    "ulURL": "empty.php",
    "pingURL": "empty.php",
    "getIpURL": "getIP.php"
  }
]
```

**Note:** When using Docker, the LibreSpeed CLI tool (`librespeed-cli`) is automatically included in the container.

### Database

Netronome supports two database backends:

1. **SQLite** (Default)
   - No additional setup required

2. **PostgreSQL**
   - Configure via:
     ```bash
     NETRONOME__DB_TYPE=postgres
     NETRONOME__DB_HOST=localhost
     NETRONOME__DB_PORT=5432
     NETRONOME__DB_USER=postgres
     NETRONOME__DB_PASSWORD=your-password
     NETRONOME__DB_NAME=netronome
     NETRONOME__DB_SSLMODE=disable
     ```

### Authentication

Netronome supports two authentication methods:

1. **Built-in Authentication**
   - Username/password authentication
   - Default option if no OIDC is configured

2. **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
   - Integration with identity providers (Google, Okta, Auth0, Keycloak, Pocket-ID, Authelia, Authentik etc.)
   - PKCE support
   - Configure via environment variables:
     ```bash
     OIDC_ISSUER=https://pocketid.domain.net
     OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
     OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
     OIDC_REDIRECT_URL=https://netronome.domain.net/api/auth/oidc/callback
     ```

3. **IP Whitelisting**
   - Bypass authentication for specific network ranges or IP addresses.
   - Configure in `config.toml` using CIDR notation:
     ```toml
     [auth]
     whitelist = ["127.0.0.1/32"]
     ```

### Packet Loss Monitoring

Netronome features a comprehensive packet loss monitoring system integrated into the unified traceroute interface:

#### Key Features

- **Unified Interface**: Switch between single traceroute tests and continuous monitoring in one tab
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Choose between interval-based (10s to 24h) or exact daily times
- **Auto-start Monitors**: Option to start monitoring immediately upon creation
- **Real-time Progress**: Live test progress with animated indicators during active testing
- **Multiple Test Types**: ICMP ping with automatic MTR fallback for detailed hop analysis
- **Historical Tracking**: Performance trend charts showing packet loss and RTT over time
- **Monitor Lifecycle**: Full start/stop/edit/delete capabilities with visual status indicators
- **Schedule Visualization**: Color-coded badges showing monitoring schedules and states
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows with appropriate privileges

#### Monitor States

- **Active Monitoring**: Running on schedule with real-time status updates
- **Stopped**: Manually stopped, schedule visible but monitoring disabled
- **Testing**: Currently running a test with live progress indication

#### Important Notes on Monitor Startup Behavior

By default, packet loss monitors **DO NOT** start automatically when Netronome starts. This prevents:

- Network congestion from multiple simultaneous tests
- False packet loss readings due to concurrent ICMP traffic
- Unexpected network usage on startup

Monitors will run on their configured intervals after being manually started by users. If you want monitors to start immediately on program startup (not recommended), you can set:

```toml
[speedtest.packetloss]
restore_monitors_on_startup = true  # WARNING: This will immediately run ALL enabled monitors
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Setting `restore_monitors_on_startup = true` will cause ALL enabled monitors to run their tests immediately when Netronome starts, which can cause significant network traffic and potentially inaccurate results due to congestion.

### GeoIP Configuration

Netronome can display country flags and ASN information in traceroute results using MaxMind's GeoLite2 databases.

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Get a MaxMind License Key**
   - Sign up for a free account at [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup)
   - Generate a license key in your account dashboard

2. **Download the Databases**

   ```bash
   # Download GeoLite2-Country database (for country flags)
   curl -L "https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=GeoLite2-Country&license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&suffix=tar.gz" -o GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz
   tar -xzf GeoLite2-Country.tar.gz
   cp GeoLite2-Country_*/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb /path/to/your/databases/

   # Download GeoLite2-ASN database (for ASN information)
   curl -L "https://download.maxmind.com/app/geoip_download?edition_id=GeoLite2-ASN&license_key=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY&suffix=tar.gz" -o GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz
   tar -xzf GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz
   cp GeoLite2-ASN_*/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb /path/to/your/databases/
   ```

3. **Configure Netronome**

   ```toml
   [geoip]
   country_database_path = "/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb"
   asn_database_path = "/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb"
   ```

   Or using environment variables:

   ```bash
   NETRONOME__GEOIP_COUNTRY_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
   NETRONOME__GEOIP_ASN_DATABASE_PATH=/path/to/your/databases/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb
   ```

**Note:** Both databases are optional. You can configure only one if you only want country flags or ASN information. The databases should be updated monthly for best accuracy.

#### Understanding MTR Packet Loss Calculations

MTR displays two types of packet loss measurements that serve different purposes:

1. **Overall Packet Loss** - Measures end-to-end connectivity to the final destination
2. **Hop-by-Hop Loss** - Shows packet loss at each intermediate router along the path

**Why Overall Loss Can Be 0% Despite Intermediate Hop Timeouts:**

It's common and normal to see 100% packet loss at intermediate hops (showing as timeouts) while overall packet loss remains 0%. This occurs because:

- **Security Policies**: Many routers block or rate-limit ICMP responses for security reasons
- **Router Configuration**: Routers prioritize data forwarding over responding to diagnostic packets
- **Load Balancing**: Actual traffic may take different paths than probe packets
- **Network Design**: Intermediate infrastructure may be "invisible" to traceroute but still functional

**Practical Interpretation:**

- **0% overall loss** = Your connection to the destination is working perfectly
- **100% loss at intermediate hops** = Those routers don't respond to probes, but they're still forwarding your traffic

This is why MTR shows both metrics - overall connectivity health (most important for users) and detailed path analysis (useful for network troubleshooting). The overall packet loss percentage is the primary indicator of your actual network performance to the destination.

### Notifications

Netronome can send notifications to a webhook URL after each speed test. This is useful for integrating with services like Discord, Slack, or any other service that accepts webhooks.

To enable notifications, you need to set the following in your `config.toml` or as environment variables:

```toml
[notifications]
enabled = true
webhook_url = "your-webhook-url"
ping_threshold = 30
upload_threshold = 200
download_threshold = 200
discord_mention_id = ""
```

- `enabled` - Enable or disable notifications
- `webhook_url` - The webhook URL to send notifications to
- `ping_threshold` - The ping threshold in ms. If the ping is higher than this value, a notification will be sent.
- `upload_threshold` - The upload threshold in Mbps. If the upload speed is lower than this value, a notification will be sent.
- `download_threshold` - The download threshold in Mbps. If the download speed is lower than this value, a notification will be sent.
- `discord_mention_id` - Optional. A Discord user ID or role ID to mention when an alert is triggered. For example, `123456789012345678` for a user or `&123456789012345678` for a role.

### CLI Commands

Netronome provides several command-line commands:

- `generate-config` - Generate a default configuration file to `~/.config/netronome/config.toml`
- `serve` - Starts the Netronome server
- `create-user` - Create a new user
- `change-password` - Change password for an existing user

Examples:

```bash
netronome generate-config

# Create a new user (interactive)
netronome --config /home/username/.config/netronome/config.toml create-user username

# Create a new user (non-interactive)
echo "password123" | netronome --config /home/username/.config/netronome/config.toml create-user username

# Change user password (interactive)
netronome --config /home/username/.config/netronome/config.toml change-password username

# Change user password (non-interactive)
echo "newpassword123" | netronome --config /home/username/.config/netronome/config.toml change-password username
```
